# PyInstaller spec for ViDrop — packages the local Flask server + built React
# frontend + vendored ffmpeg into a standalone macOS .app that each end user
# installs and runs 100% on their own machine (no owner server involved).
#
# Build:  pyinstaller packaging/vidrop.spec --noconfirm   (run from the repo root; scripts/build.sh does)
# PyInstaller resolves relative paths against THIS file's folder (SPECPATH), so every path below is
# anchored to ROOT, the repo root, one level up.
# Output: <distpath>/ViDrop.app (scripts/build.sh publishes it under release/v<VERSION>/)

# Two vendored ffmpeg binaries live in vendor/ffmpeg/: `ffmpeg` (arm64-native,
# built with dylibbundler from Homebrew's own ffmpeg so it's self-contained
# via its sibling libs/ dylibs - no Homebrew needed at runtime; see
# docs/internal/MISTAKES.md 2026-08-29) for Apple Silicon, and `ffmpeg-x86_64` (statically
# linked codecs, zero external dylib deps) for Intel. Build on the machine
# matching the target architecture - this spec picks the matching source
# automatically via platform.machine(), so the same spec produces a
# correctly-native app on either kind of Mac without manual file-swapping.
# The bundled file must always be literally named "ffmpeg"
# (get_ffmpeg_path()'s resource_path("ffmpeg") expectation), so the chosen
# source is staged under that name before PyInstaller ever sees it.
# The version number lives in ONE place, frontend/package.json (and its lock file, kept equal
# by tests/test_release_version.py). The app's Info.plist and scripts/build.sh read it from there.

# in C-extension deps (lz4, pycryptodomex); collect it so the frozen app can still
# auto-extract Instagram cookies from the user's browser. curl_cffi wraps a
# native libcurl-impersonate binary yt-dlp uses to impersonate a real
# browser's TLS/HTTP fingerprint (see requirements.txt) - without collecting
# it explicitly the frozen app would silently lack impersonation even though
# curl_cffi is installed at build time. playwright (backend/webscan.py) ships
# its own embedded Node-based driver binary alongside the Python package -
# collect_all() picks that up too, but NOT the actual Chromium browser engine:
# that has no pip package at all and is fetched separately at first use by
# `playwright install chromium` (see requirements.txt and webscan._ensure_chromium).
