# Troubleshooting Check/Download Failures

**🇬🇧 English&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[🇻🇳 Tiếng Việt](TROUBLESHOOTING.vi.md)**

If pasting a link into ViDrop fails to check, or a download keeps failing, this guide walks
through the most common causes and the two built-in tools that make this diagnosable instead of a
guessing game.

If you haven't opened ViDrop for the first time yet, or you're seeing a macOS security prompt
instead of an in-app error, see [First Launch & macOS Security Warnings](FIRST_LAUNCH.md) instead.

## Start here: the two Settings tools

Before anything else, know that Settings has two tools built for exactly this situation:

- **Diagnostic Logs** (Settings → Diagnostic Logs → **Open Log Folder**) — opens a folder
  containing `errors.log`, which records the *real*, technical reason behind a failure even when
  the app only shows you a short, friendly message. If you're reporting a bug, this file's
  contents are the single most useful thing you can attach.
- **Reset App Data** (Settings → Reset App Data → **Clear Cache & Reset Settings**) — clears
  ViDrop's saved settings (download folder, saved login info) and starts fresh. This does **not**
  delete anything you've already downloaded. Use this when a failure doesn't make sense given
  what you know to be true (e.g. "I'm definitely logged into Instagram, but it says no session
  found") — a stale saved setting from a previous version is a common cause.

## ViDrop keeps opening new windows / the Dock fills up with ViDrop icons

Fixed as of the build that includes this note (check **Settings → About** for your version). An
older build had no protection against opening twice: clicking the Dock/Finder/Launchpad icon a
second time — including once while the app was still starting up a couple of seconds in — created
a whole new copy of ViDrop with its own window and its own Dock icon, instead of just showing the
window that was already open. Each extra copy looked like it worked (it just displayed the same
thing the first one was already serving), so there was no obvious sign anything was wrong other
than the Dock slowly filling up with identical icons over repeated opens.

**If you're on a build that already has this fix** (see Settings → About), this cannot happen
anymore — opening the app again just brings the existing window to the front.

**If you're stuck with a pile of ViDrop icons from before updating:**

1. **Quit every copy at once** — open **Terminal** (Applications → Utilities → Terminal) and run:
   ```
   killall ViDrop
   ```
   This closes every running ViDrop process in one go. If you'd rather not use Terminal, press
   **⌘ Option Esc** to open Force Quit Applications, select **ViDrop**, click **Force Quit**, and
   repeat for as many "ViDrop" entries as appear in that list.
2. **Clear the leftover icons from the Dock itself** (quitting the processes above doesn't always
   make the Dock redraw on its own): open Terminal and run:
   ```
   killall Dock
   ```
   This only restarts the Dock (a visual refresh) — no files, settings, or other open apps are
   affected. If you'd rather avoid Terminal entirely, logging out and back in (or restarting your
   Mac) clears it the same way.
3. Update to the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/quangdng95/ViDrop/releases/latest)
   if you haven't already, so this doesn't come back.

## Common messages and what they mean

ViDrop's error messages follow the language you chose in Settings. The quotes below are the
Vietnamese text; the English version says the same thing. Each section explains what the message
means and what to do.

### Wrong build for your Mac's chip

> ❌ Lỗi: Bản ViDrop này không tương thích với chip của máy Mac bạn đang dùng (kiến trúc ...).
> Vui lòng tải đúng bản dành cho máy bạn (ViDrop-AppleSilicon.dmg hoặc ViDrop-Intel.dmg) tại
> trang GitHub Releases của ViDrop.

ViDrop ships two separate builds — one native to Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) and one native to
Intel — because the bundled `ffmpeg` tool only runs on the chip it was built for. This message
means you installed the wrong one for your Mac.

**Fix:** re-download from [the Download section of the README](../README.md#download) or
[Releases](https://github.com/quangdng95/ViDrop/releases/latest), picking
**ViDrop-AppleSilicon.dmg** for an M1/M2/M3/M4 Mac or **ViDrop-Intel.dmg** for an Intel Mac.
Not sure which you have? Apple menu (top-left) → **About This Mac** — it names the chip directly.

### "Cannot download from a Private account"

> ❌ Lỗi: Không thể tải video từ tài khoản Private (Kín). ViDrop hiện tại chỉ hỗ trợ tải nội
> dung Public (Công khai).

This message covers two different situations that ViDrop can't always tell apart:

1. The account/post really is set to Private, and you don't follow it from a logged-in session on
   this Mac — this is expected; ViDrop only reaches what your own logged-in account can see.
2. Your saved Instagram/Threads login session has gone stale or expired — the platform's response
   looks the same either way, so ViDrop can't always distinguish "genuinely private" from
   "your session died."

**Try this:** open the link in your browser first — if you can see it there without being asked to
log in, it's public, and you're most likely hitting case 2. Try **Reset App Data**, then retry
the link. If you're still logged into Instagram/Threads in your browser, ViDrop will pick up a
fresh session automatically on the next attempt.

### "No Instagram/Threads session found"

> ❌ Lỗi: Không tìm thấy phiên đăng nhập Instagram nào trên trình duyệt của máy này. Vui lòng
> đăng nhập Instagram trên Chrome/Safari/Brave (hoặc thêm cookies.txt thủ công trong Settings) rồi
> thử lại.
>
> *(Threads: ❌ Lỗi: Cần một trình duyệt đã đăng nhập Threads (threads.com) trên máy này để tải
> bài viết. Vui lòng đăng nhập rồi thử lại.)*

ViDrop looks for a logged-in Instagram or Threads session in your local browsers (Chrome,
Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, Safari) automatically — you never need to export cookies by hand.
This message means it didn't find one. Make sure:

- You're actually logged into Instagram or Threads in one of those browsers on **this** Mac.
- You clicked **Allow** or **Always Allow** on the Keychain permission prompt — see
  [First Launch & macOS Security Warnings](FIRST_LAUNCH.md#2-vidrop-wants-to-use-your-confidential-information-stored-in-chrome-safe-storage-in-your-keychain)
  if you're not sure what that was.

Safari's cookies are protected by macOS in a way ViDrop currently can't read at all (a
system-level restriction, not something ViDrop can bypass) — if Safari is your only browser
with an Instagram/Threads login, use Chrome, Brave, or Edge instead for those platforms.

### "Unable to connect / network error"

> ❌ Lỗi: Không thể kết nối mạng để xử lý liên kết này. Vui lòng kiểm tra kết nối Internet (hoặc
> tường lửa/VPN) rồi thử lại.

ViDrop couldn't reach the internet to process the link. Check your Wi-Fi/Ethernet connection,
and if you're on a VPN or a restrictive firewall, try temporarily disabling it — some corporate or
school networks block the platforms ViDrop talks to.

### "Your IP is temporarily blocked/limited by this platform"

> ❌ Lỗi: IP của bạn đang tạm thời bị nền tảng này chặn/giới hạn. Vui lòng thử lại sau ít phút
> hoặc đổi mạng.

Some platforms (TikTok especially) rate-limit or temporarily block an IP address that makes too
many requests in a short time. Wait a few minutes and try again, or switch networks (e.g. mobile
hotspot) if it persists.

### "Couldn't read this LinkedIn post"

> ❌ Error: Couldn't read this LinkedIn post. It may have been removed or be private, or it is a
> document/slide (PDF) whose pages couldn't be read.

LinkedIn video, image **and** native document/slide-deck (PDF) posts are supported — a document is
listed with one image per page, like a carousel. `lnkd.in` share links work too. This message means
the post itself couldn't be read: it was removed, it isn't public, or LinkedIn changed how it
serves it. Open the link in a private browser window to check it is public; if it is and the
message persists, a GitHub Issue with the link helps.

### "YouTube wants you signed in before it allows this download"

YouTube sometimes refuses a download with "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot", even for a short
public video. On the Mac app, open **Settings → YouTube sign-in** and choose the Chrome profile
where you're signed in to YouTube, then press Retry. ViDrop uses that YouTube login only when
YouTube asks for it. macOS may ask for Keychain access: choose **Always Allow**. It's off by
default, and only Chrome is supported.

### "This RedNote link has expired"

RedNote share links stop working after a while. Open the post in RedNote, copy a fresh share link
and paste that one.

### "This video has no audio track"

You picked **Audio Only** for a video that has no sound (some X clips are silent). Pick a video
quality instead.

### RedNote asks you to sign in

> ❌ Error: RedNote requires a signed-in session to view this post.

RedNote now sends every post page to its login screen, so a RedNote login is required. On the
desktop app, sign in to RedNote (rednote.com) in a browser on this Mac and try again. On the cloud
deployment, the Mac that syncs cookies (see `remote_web/README.md`) must be signed in to RedNote.

### A generic "couldn't process this link" message

> ❌ Lỗi: Không thể xử lý liên kết này. Vui lòng kiểm tra lại link hoặc thử lại sau.

This is ViDrop's fallback for an error it doesn't have a specific, friendly explanation for.
This is exactly what `errors.log` is for — open **Settings → Diagnostic Logs → Open Log Folder**,
open `errors.log`, and look for the most recent entry (they're timestamped). If you're reporting
this as a bug, include that entry's full text.

## Still not working?

1. Try **Reset App Data** once (Settings), then retry the link.
2. Quit and reopen ViDrop.
3. Check `errors.log` (Settings → Diagnostic Logs) for the specific error.
4. If none of that resolves it, open a
   [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/quangdng95/ViDrop/issues) with the link (if not
   private/sensitive), your Mac's chip and macOS version, and the relevant `errors.log` entry —
   see [Support & Issues](../README.md#support--issues) in the main README.
